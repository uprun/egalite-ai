start with simple implementation and see where it gets you</br>

unfortunatelly or even fortunatelly you can find connection between anything</br>
it can be a silly connection but still a connection</br>
Everything is made of atoms</br>

I will not reach levels of ChatGPT or DeepSeek R1 but I will try to explore alternative path</br>
I will start with reasoning in a form of chat</br>

</br>
but I might re-use simple models, simple LLM models</br>
in one of the videos of theo-3g he copied thinking part of r1 as a context to claude and asked same question and claude answered</br>
if I can provide some of the thinking part as an algorithm I might achieve good-enough results with less compute</br>

you can rewrite any rule<br>
